### Introduction to Computer Science 
Eduardo Leite

### General Overview
This is unit 1 in course Introduction to CS- taught to 9th graders.

### Motivation for Unit



In addition, we believe that it is important for students to have a basic understanding of what happens at the machine level when they code. In a typical, basic coding class, students are all too eager to start pressing keys or moving blocks to create code, which is good enough when the goal is for students to just have fun with coding. However, as we turn the basic coding into a CS class, they need to envision the environment where their code actually executes the commands.  

Preferably, this would be a unit 1 or a unit 1 in an Introduction to Computer Science (Creative Web) or (TEALS) at the high school level.   The unit should not take longer than a week of teaching followed by a few days when the students are assigned a project: to create a computer.
