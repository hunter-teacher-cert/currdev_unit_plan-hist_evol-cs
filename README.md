### Introduction to Computer Science 
by Michele P and Eduardo L

### General Overview
This is unit 0 or unit 1 for any computer science middle or high school class. 

# Motivation for Unit
The proposed unit plan will be on the history/evolution of computers, computing languages, hardware, software, memory, processing, networking and basic keyboarding.    
The purpose is to provide students with foundational skills and for them to see how the past, present and future are related and their roles as consumers and or producers of technology. 
There is a disconnect between students and past and present technology and how we got here. 
Students have various exposures to computer education so this unit will help to build background knowledge. 

Standards Referenced
(select one of the standards sets reviewed in class (CSTA, NY, MA, RI), include a link and a brief explanation as to why you selected that set)

# Tools Used
(include programming language(s), specific programs/environments, and other tools (digital or otherwise) if necessary)

# Resources
(include any links/books/readings to be used during this unit)

# Lessons
Total lenght: 2 Weeks
1. What is a computer? What are the basic components? We would introduce the most important parts of the computer and what they do.
2. How have computers changed over time? We might introduce Ada Lovelace and Charles Babage and their seminal work in the field of computing. It would be very inspiring for the girls.

3. How do computers work? Here we would like to show to the students what happens when they hit the enter key.

4. What are coding languages? What is the difference between an algorithm and a program? What are the different languages used for?
5. How have computer languages changed over time? We might introduce Grace Hopper, the woman who invented Cobol.
