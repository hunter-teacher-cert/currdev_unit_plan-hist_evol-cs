##Michele P and Eduardo
###The proposed unit plan will be on the history/evolution of computers, computing languages, hardware, software, memory, processing, basic networking.  The purpose is to provide students with foundational skills and for them to see how the past, present and future are related and their roles as consumers and or producers of technology. There is a disconnect between students and past and present technology and how we got here. Students have various exposures to computer education so this unit will help to build background knowledge. 

#####In addition, we believe that it is important for students to have a basic understanding of what happens at the machine level when they code. In a typical, basic coding class, students are all too eager to start pressing keys or moving blocks to create code, which is good enough when the goal is for students to just have fun with coding. However, as we turn the basic coding into a CS class, they need to envision the environment where their code actually executes the commands.  

#####Preferably, this would be a unit 0 or a unit 1 in an Introduction to Computer Science (Creative Web) or (TEALS) at the high school level. Middle School students may not benefit from this unit due to their stage of intellectual development and inability to to think abstractly.  The unit should not take longer than a week of teaching followed by a few days when the students are assigned a project: to create a computer.

###Lessons
#####What is a computer? What are the basic components? We would introduce the most important parts of the computer and what they do.
#####How have computers changed over time? We might introduce Ada Lovelace and Charles Babage and their seminal work in the field of computing. It would be very inspiring for the girls.

#####How do computers work? Here we would like to show to the students what happens when they hit the enter key.

#####What are coding languages? What is the difference between an algorithm and a program? What are the different languages used for?
#####How have computer languages changed over time? We might introduce Grace Hopper, the woman who invented Cobol.
